#NOTES#
Recipe was made in a 6 quart Instant Pot electric pressure cooker.
Be sure to rinse rice before using. If you donâ€™t use lean ground beef, you may want to drain beef and add spices after draining.
Can substitute your favorite taco seasoning for the spices.
Use 1 can of diced tomatoes instead of salsa for a milder version.
